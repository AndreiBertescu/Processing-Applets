# Processing-Applets
A collection of small Processing programs to visualize mathematical models and others.

-----------------------------------

**Chess**: A 2-player chess game; it has a color indicator for the current turn and lists all lost pieces.

**Circle_Packing**: An algorithm which places multiple points at random coordinates; each point chooses the color at its origin and keeps expanding until it reaches the end of the frame or hits another circle.

**Conway's_Game_of_Life**: As the title says, it reproduces the famous ruleset of the Game of Life - Now in fullscreen!

**Cube_Wave**: It reproduces a video by The Coding Train. It simulates a sinusoidal wave in 3D space: [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H81Tdrmz2LA&t=47s)

**Electric_Field**: An app in which you can place electric charges and see the electromagnetic fields that they form.

**Flocking_2D**: A simulation for flying boids. Each boid calculates the separation, cohesion, and alignment vectors that output a movement direction and velocity to simulate a real flock of birds.

**Flocking_3D**: Same as Flocking_2D, but extended to the third dimension and limited to the dimensions of a cube of variable sides.

**Flow_Field**: An applet in which you can visualize the vector field of three types of functions: Perlin noise, tangent, and sin/cos. It has two working modes: it can simply visualize the vector field or be used to place numerous particles that follow the underlying vector field, thus creating beautiful art.

**Fractal_Triangle**: It creates a colorful triangle fractal.

**Graph_Map**: It creates a moving network of connected nodes that try to recreate various similar-looking background images I found on the internet.

**Graphs**: An applet which I used in high school to visualize various graphs.

**Height_Map**: Inspired by the Sebastian Lague video about procedural planet generation. It takes a black and white image of a planetoid, representing the height map, and creates a 3D model of that image. It already has the height maps for Earth and the Moon, but any image can be added. [Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0cONs3T0By4puYy6GM22ko8)

**Height_Map_S**: The same idea as Height_Map, but projected on a sphere. I also added a JSON file containing data about cities around the world which I used to simulate nighttime lights.

**Logic_Game**: An app where you can create various logic circuits (maybe even a CPU). It has input ports on the left and output ports on the right, along with a list of already created logic chips. Each logic chip can be deleted or explored, i.e., seeing its insides (except the 'not' and 'and' gates, which are elemental).

**Logic_Game_V2**: An upgraded version of the first Logic_Game; it has a proper worksheet where you can place a lot more IO ports and other chips. The worksheet can now be resized and moved, and the logic chips now have a 'BigPort', which you can use to connect all the wires associated with it.

**Lorentz_System**: A simulation of a beautiful Lorentz system, which has been mirrored to resemble a butterfly.

**Mandel_Bulb**: An applet which can generate variations of the Mandelbulb. [Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbulb)

**Mandelbrot_Set**: Fractal generation of different fractal images; it has two modes: the Mandelbrot set and the Julia set. [Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)

**Maurer_Rose**: A simple app which draws Maurer roses. [Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurer_rose)

**Maze_Generator**: A backtracking maze generator.

**Maze_Generator_Fullscreen**: A backtracking maze generator, now in fullscreen!

**Quad_Tree**: An implementation of a quad tree which I used in the flocking apps to increase efficiency; it has two operations: you can place points or query a certain area to see all the points that it contains.

**Snake**: A simple Snake game.

**Triangles**: Inspired by a long-deleted TikTok; it consists of multiple triangles of pseudo-random colors which subdivide into 4 equal triangles with the original color, either incremented or decremented by a set amount, thus creating beautiful patterns.

**Ulam_Spiral**: An implementation of the Ulam spiral. [Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral)
